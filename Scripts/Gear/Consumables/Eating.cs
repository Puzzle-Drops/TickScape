/// <summary>
/// Manages food and potion consumption delays.
/// SDK Reference: Eating.ts
/// 
/// OSRS EATING SYSTEM:
/// - Food delay: 3 ticks (1.8 seconds) between eating
/// - Potion delay: Shares food delay
/// - Combo delay: Karambwan has separate 3-tick delay
/// - Attack delay: +3 ticks added when eating
/// 
/// CONSUMPTION PATTERN:
/// 1. Player clicks food/potion (eatFood/drinkPotion)
/// 2. Item stored in currentFood/currentPotion
/// 3. Delay set to 3 ticks
/// 4. Next tick: tickFood() consumes item and applies effect
/// 5. Delay counts down until can eat again
/// 
/// TICK SEQUENCE EXAMPLE:
/// Tick 0: Click shark → currentFood = shark, foodDelay = 3
/// Tick 1: tickFood() eats shark (heal 20), foodDelay = 2
/// Tick 2: foodDelay = 1
/// Tick 3: foodDelay = 0
/// Tick 4: Can eat again (foodDelay <= 0)
/// </summary>
